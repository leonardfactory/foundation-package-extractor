## Credits

This work has been inspired by the awesome community of Foundation and the previous work done by [PegasusEpsilon](https://github.com/PegasusEpsilon/foundation-package-tools). Given it's not working anymore, I made a new tool from scratch since I wanted it to be OSS and to be released under MIT.
